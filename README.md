**Matter** is a unified IP-based connectivity protocol that is designed to connect and build open, reliable and secure IoT ecosystems. This new technology and connectivity standard enables communication among a wide range of smart devices. Matter supports IP connectivity over Wi-Fi, Thread and Ethernet.  

**Espressif’s SDK for Matter**  is the official Matter development framework for Espressif’s ESP32 series SoCs.

- It is built on top of the open source Matter SDK, and provides simplified APIs, commonly used peripherals, tools and utilities for security, manufacturing and production accompanied by exhaustive documentation. It includes rich production references, aimed to simplify the development process of Matter products and enable the users to go to production in the shortest possible time.

**Getting Started:**  
In order to use and get started with Matter on ESP32, you need to install some software packages based on your Operating System. This setup guide helps you on getting everything installed on Linux.

This tutorial is about Setting up Development Environment for Matter in Ubuntu OS. We've discussed..  
- **Matter SDK Programming Guide** - Basic Introduction. 
- **ESP-IDF Setup** - This is a detailed roadmap to walk you through the installation process. We've already covered that in previous Tutorial
- **Matter Setup** - This is a detailed roadmap to walk you through the installation process.  
- **First Steps on ESP-IDF for Matter** - Project Creation
- **Getting Started Projects** - Blink Demo
- **Menu Configuration Tool Demo** using ESP32C3 and C6 Dev Board  

**Software**
- Ubuntu OS 22.04 LTS  
- Matter SDK  
- Visual Studio Code IDE
- ESP-IDF Extension in VSCode  

**Hardware**

📕 **YouTube Video Links**  

- This tutorial is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will see how to install, set-up, and configure the VSCode and ESP-IDF Extension, in Ubuntu OS. Then, in next part. The part 2. using that setup, We will see demo of how to program 2 different ESP32 boards with Matter firmware. We will program these ESP32 boards as Matter-accessories or end-devices.
